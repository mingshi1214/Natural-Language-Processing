The expected trend was that as the dataset gets bigger, the accuracy in the model predictions
also improve. This is because the more data we have, the more patterns that can be realised 
between different political stances. This was found to be true as the accuracy improves steadily
as the amount of training data increased. The accuracy went from 32.6% at 1000 data points to 
39.2% with 20000 data points for training.
