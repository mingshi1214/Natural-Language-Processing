DISCUSSION:
----
I found that with no attention the preformance was lower after 5 epochs with a higher loss.
With multihead attention did similar to single-headed attention during training and out preformed
no attention in training having an end loss of 1.26178 and an average BLEU score
of 0.32432.

This is to be expected as multiheaded attention allows the model to jointly attent to information
from different representations of subspaces at different position. With just one head or no attention,
it does not allow for this. However, it was expected that with multihead attention would preform better 
than single head attention in training. With multihead attention only had a difference of 0.0005 from
the best training result which was With Single-head Attention. This slight discrepancy can be ignored as 
during testing, it was proven that multiheaded attention preforms better.

With attention models do better than without. This preformance is to be expected as it uses a better
selection of prior words to consider at the current time step. With attention models use a better context
by considering it over a longer sequence and by looking at the sequence holistically to understand it's meaning.

Testing results overall had a higher average bleu score than the final epoch bleu scores for all models.
This may be due to having different data in the Test sample. Due to having a different set to the train data,
this causes the slight discrepancy between final epoch BLEU scores and final test BLEU scores. The difference
was at most 0.042 which is not too much of a difference to indicate a flaw in the logic of the code.

We expect that the test results would be lower than the train results. Some explinations include: The test set is 
easier than the train set and have a reduced bias compared to the large train set. The model could be generalizing
well to the train set and it has not overfit so that the results from the test set were good.
