def train_for_epoch(model, dataloader, optimizer, device):
    '''Train an EncoderDecoder for an epoch

    An epoch is one full loop through the training data. This function:

    1. Defines a loss function using :class:`torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`,
       keeping track of what id the loss considers "padding"
    2. For every iteration of the `dataloader` (which yields triples
       ``F, F_lens, E``)
       1. Sends ``F`` to the appropriate device using ``F = F.to(device)``. Same
          for ``F_lens`` and ``E``.
       2. Zeros out the model's previous gradient with ``optimizer.zero_grad()``
       3. Calls ``logits = model(F, F_lens, E)`` to determine next-token
          probabilities.
       4. Modifies ``E`` for the loss function, getting rid of a token and
          replacing excess end-of-sequence tokens with padding using
        ``model.get_target_padding_mask()`` and ``torch.masked_fill``
       5. Flattens out the sequence dimension into the batch dimension of both
          ``logits`` and ``E``
       6. Calls ``loss = loss_fn(logits, E)`` to calculate the batch loss
       7. Calls ``loss.backward()`` to backpropagate gradients through
          ``model``
       8. Calls ``optim.step()`` to update model parameters
    3. Returns the average loss over sequences

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : EncoderDecoder
        The model we're training.
    dataloader : HansardDataLoader
        Serves up batches of data.
    device : torch.device
        A torch device, like 'cpu' or 'cuda'. Where to perform computations.
    optimizer : torch.optim.Optimizer
        Implements some algorithm for updating parameters using gradient
        calculations.

    Returns
    -------
    avg_loss : float
        The total loss divided by the total numer of sequence

    Parameters
    ----------

    Returns

def compute_average_bleu_over_dataset(
        model, dataloader, target_sos, target_eos, device):
    '''Determine the average BLEU score across sequences

    This function computes the average BLEU score across all sequences in
    a single loop through the `dataloader`.

    1. For every iteration of the `dataloader` (which yields triples
       ``F, F_lens, E_ref``):
       1. Sends ``F`` to the appropriate device using ``F = F.to(device)``. Same
          for ``F_lens``. No need for ``E_cand``, since it will always be
          compared on the CPU.
       2. Performs a beam search by calling ``b_1 = model(F, F_lens)``
       3. Extracts the top path per beam as ``E_cand = b_1[..., 0]``
       4. Computes the total BLEU score of the batch using
          :func:`compute_batch_total_bleu`
    2. Returns the average per-sequence BLEU score

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : EncoderDecoder
        The model we're testing.
    dataloader : HansardDataLoader
        Serves up batches of data.
    target_sos : int
        The ID of the start-of-sequence tag in the target vocabulary.
    target_eos : int
        The ID of the end-of-sequence tag in the target vocabulary.

    Returns
    -------
    avg_bleu : float
        The total BLEU score summed over all sequences divided by the number of
        sequences
